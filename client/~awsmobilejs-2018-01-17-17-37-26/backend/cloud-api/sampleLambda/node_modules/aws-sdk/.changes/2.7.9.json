The local compute is AWS Lambda powered by AWS Greengrass, and the local storage is compatible with Amazon S3. Each 100 TB Snowball Edge can use the storage and compute power of the AWS cloud locally in places where connecting to the internet may not be an option. Additionally, Snowball Edges can be used in clusters for applications that require greater data durability."
